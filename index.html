        Verse 1:
        Get up, stand up
        Stand up for your right
        Get up, stand up
        Stand up for your right
        Get up, stand up
        Stand up for your right
        Get up, stand up
        Don't give up the fight
        
        Chorus:
        Preacher man don't tell me
        Heaven is under the earth
        I know you don't know
        What life is really worth
        
        
        Verse 2:
        He said all that glitters is gold
        Half that story ain't never been told
        So now you see the light, hey
        You stand up for your right
        Come on
        
        Chorus:
        Get up, stand up
        Stand up for your right
        Get up, stand up
        Don't give up the fight
        Get up, stand up
        Stand up for your right
        Get up, stand up
        Don't give up the fight
        
        Verse 3:
        Most people think
        Great God will come from the sky
        Take away everything
        And make everybody feel high
        But if you know what life is worth
        You would look for yours on earth
        And now a you see the light
        You stand up for your right
        Jah!
        
        Chorus:
        Get up, stand up (Jah, Jah)
        Stand up for your right (oh-hoo)
        Get up, stand up (get up, stand up)
        Don't give up the fight (life is your right)
        Get up, stand up (so we can't give up the fight)
        Stand up for your rights (Lord, Lord)
        Get up, stand up (keep on struggling on)
        Don't give up the fight (yeah)
        
        Verse 4:
        Get up, stand up
        Stand up for your right
        Get up, stand up
        Don't give up the fight
        Get up, stand up
